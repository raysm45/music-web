> This is the **frontend** application. It talks to a companion Node.js/Express backend for search, streaming, auth, and realtime rooms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A running instance of the [Aivy backend](#) (or access to a hosted one)

### Installation

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd aivy-frontend
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Base URL of the backend API (defaults to the production API if omitted)
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:3000

# Discord Client ID (only needed for the Discord Activity integration)
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # preview the production build locally
```

## 🩺 Backend Health Detection

The app silently pings the backend in the background. If the connection genuinely drops (not just a background-tab throttle), a friendly **Server Down** screen appears as an overlay — without interrupting playback — and the app reconnects automatically once the backend is reachable again.
